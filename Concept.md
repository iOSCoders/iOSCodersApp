# iOS Coders App
To create an app for anyone who wishes to get started writing iOS applications. The app is a place for members to work on projects. It contains information about the group. A method to start learning. Embedded resources. Help on how to do things in the App Store, getting through the review process etc.

Initially it is a drawer application with a main web view. The subject is picked on the left and the web view lays it out.

Links to projects are provided, probably in a github site. Other resources are on an application Dropbox. 

Applications the group has written are accessible in the app, just like AppZilla. The application is available to the group via enterprise distribution, which is a lesson in itself. Various application are promoted to embedded applications and some are spun off with support from the group to market the app. Some of the proceed go to pay dues and such for the group, eventually becoming a non-profit.

It would be nice if Focused for Success, Inc. as a role in this. Possible by donating the new TinyTasks application, embedded and a pointer to a Pro app or Standalone app with ads. The same launchpad can be used by members of the group. Apps can be moved in and out, with pointers to them as the migrate to the app store.

You get the idea. Content is served from a server, which is a lesson in itself.
